### Situation
The Fast Charging (DCFC) network required data-driven expansion plans to meet rising EV demand. Uncertainty in charging behavior made traditional forecasting insufficient for site-specific infrastructure planning.

### Action
* ![Simulation View](/assets/img/hydro-monte-1.png)
* Figure 1: Monte Carlo simulation network
* Conducted Monte Carlo simulations on digital-twins to forecast EV charging demand and utilization rates.
* Translated simulation results into site-specific development recommendations for infrastructure stakeholders.

### Result
