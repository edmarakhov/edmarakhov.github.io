description: Statistical modeling of 52 million+ records to improve long-term energy demand forecasting.
---

### Situation
* Generating accurate BC-specific demand forecasts required the analysis of over 52 million power and weather records. 
* Existing models needed refinement to better reflect localized consumption patterns and weather sensitivity.

### Action
* Developed and fitted statistical end-use load models by leveraging SQL, SAS, and Python.
* Processed massive historical datasets to isolate variables driving peak demand across various customer segments.
