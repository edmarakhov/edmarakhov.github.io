### Situation
Generating accurate BC-specific demand forecasts required the analysis of over 52 million power and weather records. Existing models needed refinement to better reflect localized consumption patterns and weather sensitivity.

### Action
* Developed and fitted statistical end-use load models by leveraging SQL, SAS, and Python.
* Processed massive historical datasets to isolate variables driving peak demand across various customer segments.

### Result
