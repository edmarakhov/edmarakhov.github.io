description: RTG Spreader Preventative Maintenance overhaul (from RCA to deployment)
---

### Situation
* RTG spreaders were identified as a lead cause of equipment downtime (using findings from RTG Data Analysis project). 
* Existing Preventive Maintenance (PM) procedures had significant gaps in coverage and improper scheduling, leading to frequent preventable failures.

### Action

  <div style="flex: 1; font-size: 0.95rem;">
    <p><strong>Managing concurrent teams of technicians for RCA</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Field Investigation:</strong> Conducted comprehensive job hazard assessments and PM investigations alongside union technicians to identify failure points.</li>
      <li><strong>Process Optimization:</strong> Applied 5S principles to reorganize maintenance tasks, improving clarity and reducing technician error.</li>
      <li><strong>Stakeholder Alignment:</strong> Orchestrated the launch of standardized PMs, securing critical approval from the site safety committee.</li>
    </ul>

### Result
* **Operational Efficiency:** Created standardized, safe PM protocols used fleet-wide, resulting in a 40% reduction in spreader-related downtime.
* **Continuous Improvement:** Established a repeatable, data-driven framework to guide all future PM development at the terminal.
