### Situation
RTG spreaders were identified as a lead cause of equipment downtime. Existing Preventive Maintenance (PM) procedures had significant gaps in coverage and improper scheduling, leading to frequent preventable failures in the field.

### Action
* **Field Investigation:** Conducted comprehensive job hazard assessments and PM investigations alongside union technicians to identify failure points.
* **Process Optimization:** Applied 5S principles to reorganize maintenance tasks, improving clarity and reducing technician error.
* **Stakeholder Alignment:** Orchestrated the launch of standardized PMs, securing critical approval from the site safety committee.

### Result
* **Operational Efficiency:** Created standardized, safe PM protocols used fleet-wide, resulting in a 40% reduction in spreader-related downtime.
* **Continuous Improvement:** Established a repeatable, data-driven framework to guide all future PM development at the terminal.
