description: Variance analysis and interactive dashboards for RTG crane maintenance optimization.
---

### Situation
* RTG cranes experienced excessive downtime despite existing preventive maintenance (PM). 
* Maintenance leadership lacked visibility into PM content, scheduling, labor hours, and costs, with no existing cross-fleet performance analysis.

### Action
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: flex-start; gap: 15px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
  <img src="/assets/img/gct-data.jpg" alt="Dashboard" style="width: 48%; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #1c1c9e;">
  <div style="flex: 1; font-size: 0.95rem;">
    <p><strong>Power BI RTG Maintenance History Dashboard</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Conducted variance analysis across PM labor hours, scheduling, and costs for all RTG fleets.</li>
      <li>Built interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize inefficiencies and performance gaps.</li>
      <li>Presented findings to the VP of Maintenance and collaborated with the Maintenance Manager on an action plan.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

### Result
* Increased RTG crane throughput by 15%
* Increased MMBF (mean moves between failure) by 3x
* Delivered an action plan projected to eliminate 40+ annual downtime events per machine.
* Conducted a full redesign of all RTG spreader PMs and developed handover documentation for repeatable analysis across other fleets.
