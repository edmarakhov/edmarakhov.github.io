### Situation
The racing team lacked real-time vehicle data for monitoring performance and health during operation.

### Action
* Researched and tested radio modules and antennas for high-speed one-way telemetry.
* Developed embedded firmware in C and Python to serialize and transmit CAN messages using Protocol Buffers.
* Coordinated between electrical and mechanical teams to ensure integration and FSAE rule adherence.

### Result
* ![Dashboard View of Live Telemetry](/assets/img/fsae-telem-1.jpg)
Enabled real-time monitoring of critical vehicle system health and performance during track testing.
