description: SAE-compliant Power Distribution Module (PDM) design to reduce unplanned fleet downtime.
---

### Situation
* Faulty yard tractor accessory wiring harnesses caused 193.5 hours of unplanned downtime per year. 
* The existing system lacked reliability, standardization, and scalability for new devices.

### Action
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: flex-start; gap: 15px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
  <img src="/assets/img/gct-pdm-1.jpg" alt="PDM Schematic" style="width: 48%; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #1c1c9e;">
  <div style="flex: 1; font-size: 0.95rem;">
    <p><strong>PDM Schematic for Review</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed an SAE-compliant PDM delivering circuit-protected power with 6 outputs for future expansion.</li>
      <li>Coordinated with external engineering consultants for design finalization and manufacturing packaging.</li>
      <li>Led manufactured prototype audits, test installations, and developed commissioning checklists for technical staff.</li>
    </ul>

### Result
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: flex-start; gap: 15px;">
  <img src="/assets/img/gct-pdm-2.jpg" alt="Installed PDM" style="width: 48%; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #1c1c9e;">
  <div style="flex: 1; font-size: 0.95rem;">
    <p><strong>Completed and Installed PDM</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>PDMs were installed on 150 yard tractors, contributing to $250,000 in gross YOY savings from reduced downtime.</li>
      <li>The system now enables future device installations without new harnessing work.</li>
      <li>Installation of the PDMs resulted in a reduction of approximately 55,000 hours of idling per year, offsetting 368 metric tonnes of CO2, equivalent to removing 80 passenger vehicles from the road annually. </li>
    </ul>
