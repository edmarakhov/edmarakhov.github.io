description: SAE-compliant Power Distribution Module (PDM) design to reduce unplanned fleet downtime.

### Situation
[cite_start]Faulty yard tractor accessory wiring harnesses caused 193.5 hours of unplanned downtime per year[cite: 74, 75]. [cite_start]The existing system lacked reliability, standardization, and scalability for new devices[cite: 77, 78].

### Action
* [cite_start]Designed an SAE-compliant PDM delivering circuit-protected power with 6 outputs for future expansion[cite: 80].
* [cite_start]Coordinated with external engineering consultants for design finalization and manufacturing packaging[cite: 81].
* [cite_start]Led manufactured prototype audits, test installations, and developed commissioning checklists for technical staff[cite: 82].

### Result
[cite_start]PDMs were installed on 150 yard tractors, contributing to $250,000 in gross YOY savings from reduced downtime[cite: 86, 89, 90]. [cite_start]The system now enables future device installations without new harnessing work[cite: 91, 92].
