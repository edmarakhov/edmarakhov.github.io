### Situation
Faulty yard tractor accessory wiring harnesses caused 193.5 hours of unplanned downtime per year. The existing system lacked reliability, standardization, and scalability for new devices.

### Action
![PDM Schematic for Review](/assets/img/gct-pdm-1.jpg)
* PDM Schematic for Review
* Designed an SAE-compliant PDM delivering circuit-protected power with 6 outputs for future expansion.
* Coordinated with external engineering consultants for design finalization and manufacturing packaging.
* Led manufactured prototype audits, test installations, and developed commissioning checklists for technical staff.

### Result
![Completed and Installed PDM](/assets/img/gct-pdm-2.jpg)
* Completed and Installed PDM
PDMs were installed on 150 yard tractors, contributing to $250,000 in gross YOY savings from reduced downtime. The system now enables future device installations without new harnessing work.
