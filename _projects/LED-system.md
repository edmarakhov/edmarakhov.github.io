description: Wireless LED driver system with remote scheduling for high-throughput biological experiments.

### Situation
[cite_start]The existing LED system required manual brightness tuning and lacked scheduling control, leading to limited throughput and high experimental errors[cite: 113, 114].

### Action
* [cite_start]Designed an LED driver system using ESP32 for wireless scheduling and brightness control of 48V panels[cite: 116].
* [cite_start]Programmed embedded firmware in C for PWM dimming and network communication[cite: 116].
* [cite_start]Built a web/mobile interface in HTML/JavaScript hosted on the ESP32 for remote control[cite: 117].

### Result
[cite_start]Expanded capacity 5x to 13,860 cultures per experiment run[cite: 118]. [cite_start]It is now the lab standard high-throughput system and is featured in a forthcoming peer-reviewed publication[cite: 118].
