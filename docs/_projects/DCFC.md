### Situation
The Fast Charging (DCFC) network required data-driven expansion plans to meet rising EV demand. Uncertainty in charging behavior made traditional forecasting insufficient for site-specific infrastructure planning.

### Action
* Conducted Monte Carlo simulations on digital-twins to forecast EV charging demand and utilization rates.
* Translated simulation results into site-specific development recommendations for infrastructure stakeholders.

### Result
* ![Charger Site](/assets/img/hydro-monte-2.png)
Delivered a strategic roadmap for DCFC station planning that ensured future network reliability and optimized station utilization.
