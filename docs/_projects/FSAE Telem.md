### Situation
[cite_start]The racing team lacked real-time vehicle data for monitoring performance and health during operation[cite: 122].

### Action
* [cite_start]Researched and tested radio modules and antennas for high-speed one-way telemetry[cite: 124].
* [cite_start]Developed embedded firmware in C and Python to serialize and transmit CAN messages using Protocol Buffers[cite: 125].
* [cite_start]Coordinated between electrical and mechanical teams to ensure integration and FSAE rule adherence[cite: 126].

### Result
[cite_start]Enabled real-time monitoring of critical vehicle system health and performance during track testing[cite: 127].
