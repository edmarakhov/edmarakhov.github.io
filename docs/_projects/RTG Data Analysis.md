### Situation
[cite_start]RTG cranes experienced excessive downtime despite existing preventive maintenance (PM)[cite: 64]. [cite_start]Maintenance leadership lacked visibility into PM content, scheduling, labor hours, and costs, with no existing cross-fleet performance analysis[cite: 65, 66].

### Action
* [cite_start]Conducted variance analysis across PM labor hours, scheduling, and costs for all RTG fleets[cite: 59].
* [cite_start]Built interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize inefficiencies and performance gaps[cite: 60].
* [cite_start]Presented findings to the VP of Maintenance and collaborated with the Maintenance Manager on an action plan[cite: 61, 62].

### Result
[cite_start]Delivered an action plan projected to eliminate 40+ annual downtime events per machine[cite: 68]. [cite_start]Conducted a full redesign of all RTG spreader PMs and developed handover documentation for repeatable analysis across other fleets[cite: 69].
