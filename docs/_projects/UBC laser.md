### Situation
[cite_start]Required a laser to project a static image onto a flat surface through high-speed movement[cite: 130].

### Action
* ![Simulink Controls Diagram](/assets/img/laser-2.jpg)
* [cite_start]Designed and 3D printed a 2-DOF system in SOLIDWORKS to control laser direction[cite: 143].
* [cite_start]Modeled system dynamics and tuned PID controllers using Simulink[cite: 144].
* [cite_start]Integrated a PID Controller, Motor Transfer Function, and Derivative Weighted Sum Filter to optimize trajectory tracking [cite: 132-142].
* [cite_start]Implemented Feedback Weighted Sum Filters and Sensor Gains to minimize error [cite: 138-141].

### Result
[cite_start]Achieved stable laser positioning with low overshoot and accurate tracking [cite: 146-148].
