# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
I am an Electrical Engineering student at UBC specializing in the intersection of physical hardware, data systems and management. My work ranges from engineering PCBs and firmware for research-grade lighting systems, to managing end-to-end lifecycle development of SAE-compliant power distribution modules to delivering provincial provincial infrastructure planning using over 52 million energy records for forecasting. I focus on delivering clarity through data-driven frameworks and field-tested engineering.
